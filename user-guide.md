## Know Your Runner

You will see the list of all runners you are managing in this current season.

The notes you enter here are directly saved against the runner profile for future reference. The runner will not see these notes.

A green star will denote there is a note present for that runner. Click on it to expand the notes section.

You can click on three dots for any runner related action. To transfer a runner, you can select the option. You will be presented with options to choose which program to transfer the runner to. Optionally you can also add a comment and save it. The runner will show as Pending Transfer status. Once he/she is moved in Final Surge, the status of the runner will change and they will no longer appear in your cohort.

You can also defer a runner to the following season if there are extenuating circumstances. The runner will be removed from your list.
